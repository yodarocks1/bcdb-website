    <p class="succinct-off">This research project aimed to explore the relationships between various academic units at Utah State University (USU) through graph analysis. By creating a graph representation of USU's colleges, departments, programs, and courses, the study sought to understand the interconnections and similarities between these entities. The research employed various similarity scoring methods and community analysis techniques, such as the Jaccard coefficient, SimRank, and the Louvain algorithm, to determine how programs, particularly the Computer Science department, are related within the university's structure. The findings offered insights into whether Computer Science should be placed in the College of Science or Engineering and provided general guidance on program switching and minors for students. The project highlighted the importance of data quality and graph structure in educational data analysis.</p>

    <h4>Abstract:</h4>
    <p>This study shows the similarity between programs, departments, and colleges at Utah State University. With the data collected from the university’s website, connections were made between the different programs and departments. Data was collected through the university’s website and registrar. After the data was obtained and preprocessed a graph with all of the departments and associated programs and courses was created. It analyzes the similarity between programs, majors, and minors at USU using a variety of algorithms like Jaccard, SimRank, and Panther Similarity, and Common Neighbor Centrality as well as the Louvain algorithm. Computer Science is used as an example, and is shown to easily fit into either the College of Engineering or the College of Science quite easily.</p>
