        <p>Developed a web-based educational platform using Django and RestrictedPython to assist instructors in teaching Python programming through a guided, constraint-based approach. The platform allows students to code within a sandboxed environment, offering features such as code saving, hint requests, and constraint-based testing. The system provides immediate feedback, helping students with basic proficiency to progress towards correct solutions. It is designed to clarify instructor expectations and enhance learning outcomes through interactive guidance and error feedback. Future enhancements include auto-grading, improved usability, and integration with AI-driven support tools.</p>
