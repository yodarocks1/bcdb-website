    <ul>
        <li>
            Developed and implemented VERAPAK, a modular framework for adversarial robustness verification of neural networks, enhancing reliability and efficiency through novel techniques for adversarial example generation, abstraction, and partitioning.
        </li>
        <li>
            Contributed to the development and optimization of algorithms and methodologies to improve AI system robustness and mitigate safety risks, including adversarial attack defenses and anomaly detection.
        </li>
        <li>
            Improved the safety and robustness of numerous and diverse AI models by up to 99.96%.
